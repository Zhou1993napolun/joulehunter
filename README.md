Joulehunter helps you find what part of your code is consuming considerable amounts of energy.

This repo is still a work in progress. ðŸ˜„

Compatibility
------------

Joulehunter runs on **Linux** machines with **Intel RAPL** support. This technology has been available since the Sandy Bridge generation.

Installation
------------

You can install joulehunter with pip: ```pip install joulehunter```.

You can also clone the repo and install it directly:

     git clone https://github.com/powerapi-ng/joulehunter.git
     cd joulehunter
     python setup.py install

Usage
------------

### Command line

Joulehunter works similarly to [pyinstrument](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument), as we forked the repo and replaced time measuring with energy measuring. Here's [pyinstrument's documentation](https://pyinstrument.readthedocs.io/).

```joulehunter -l``` will list the available domains on this machine. These include the packages and their components, such as the DRAM and core.

The command ```joulehunter main.py``` will execute ```main.py``` and measure the energy consumption of the first package (CPU).

To select the package to analyze use the option ```-p``` or ```--package``` followed by the package number or the package name. The default value is 0.

The options ```-c``` and ```--component``` allow you to measure the energy of an individual component by specifying their name or ID. If not specified, the entire package will be selected.


#### Example

Executing ```joulehunter -l``` could output this:
    
    [0] package-0
      [0] core
      [1] uncore
      [2] dram
    [1] package-1
      [0] core
      [1] uncore
      [2] dram

If we run ```joulehunter -p package-1 -c 2 my_file.py```, joulehunter will execute ```my_file.py``` and measure the energy consumption of package-1's DRAM.

### Profiling chunks of code

As [pyinstrument's documentation](https://pyinstrument.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#profile-a-specific-chunk-of-code) shows, it's also possible to profile specific chunks of code.

Joulehunter's Profiler class can receive two additional arguments: ```package``` and ```component```. They receive the ID (as a string or integer) or name of the desired package/component. If ```package``` is not specified, ```package-0``` will be used. If ```component``` is ```None```, the entire package will be analyzed.

### Profiling web requests in Django or Flask

Using joulehunter with Django or Flask hasn't been looked into yet.

Read permission
------------

Due to a [security vulnerability](https://platypusattack.com), only root has read permission for the energy files. In order to circumvent this, run the script as root or grant read permissions for the following files:

    /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:*/energy_uj
    /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:*/intel-rapl:*:*/energy_uj
